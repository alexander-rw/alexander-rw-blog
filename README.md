# Alexander RW's Blog

This is my blog, made using 

## Backlogs

- [ ] Intergrated with PhotoSwipe.
- [ ] Add schema.org meta information.
- [ ] Transform class selector to BEM metodology.

## Installation & Running Locally

Run local server:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise.git
$ cd jekyll-klise
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This needs to use `ruby v3.1.2`. If you get an error about `require': cannot load such file -- webrick `, then you'll need to run `bundle add webrick` to get this working.
